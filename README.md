Left-right partisan ideology and climate change

This study explores how left-right partisan orientations impact national COâ‚‚ emissions, analyzing 120 countries from 1990 to 2018. Using advanced quantitative methods, the findings reveal that left-leaning governments may reduce emissions more effectively, but outcomes depend on socioeconomic and institutional contexts. Highlighting the conditional nature of ideological effects, the study emphasizes the importance of broader structural factors in shaping climate policies and offers insights for future research on climate governance.
